A Python program to write sentences in the style of Abraham Lincoln (or anyone, as it just uses Markov chains).  The goal of the project was to separate style from meaning to get a sort of very unscientific view on speech (this was a side project for a political theory class) -- can something still sound inspiring without it actually *meaning* anything?
